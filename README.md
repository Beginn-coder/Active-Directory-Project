# Active-Directory-Project

## Introduction
In the world of IT and Cybersecurity, learning Active Directory is vital for professionals and designing a homelab offers hands-on experience with essential directory services. This project allows one to enhance their skills in network administration, user management, group polices. The use of homelab provides a safe environment for simulating real-world scenarios and helps to lay a solid foundation in user authentication and access control while providing practical experience in managing network infrastructures. 

## Objectives for the project
The objective of this project is to provide hands-on experience in creating a virtualized environment for cybersecurity testing and exploitation by creating and configuring virtual machines such as Windows 10, Kali Linux, Windows Server, and Ubuntu Server. The lab aims to teach skills such as network configurations, security tool installation, endpoint monitoring, and security testing. In addition, joining windows machines to an Active Directory domain and enabling Remote Desktop. Overall, the lab enables participants to gain practical experience in cybersecurity concepts, tools, and techniques within a controlled environment.

## Tools Used
- Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager: For creating and managing virtual machines (VMs).
- Splunk Server: For log analysis and monitoring.
- Splunk Universal Forwarder: For data forwarding to Splunk.
- Sysmon: Endpoint monitoring on Windows machines.
- Crowbar: Used to simulate brute force attacks.
- Atomic Red Team (ART): Used for security testing and validation.
- PowerShell: For scripting and automation tasks.
- Microsoft Windows Event Logs: Analyzed in Splunk for security monitoring.
- Windows Server 2022: Operating system used for Active Directory Domain Services setup.
- Ubuntu Server: Used as a Splunk server in the lab setup.
- Microsoft Windows 10: Operating system for target machine in the lab.
- Kali Linux: Used as an attacker machine in the lab setup.
